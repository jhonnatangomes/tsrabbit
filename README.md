This is a typescript implementation of the tree-walk interpreter of the Lox programming language from the excellent book [Crafting Interpreters], by Robert Nystrom. I intend to add my own features to the language. This is just an exercise in learning, so I won't bother that much to make it as performant as it can be. Once I think that the language is finished, I can start working on improving it performance-wise.
